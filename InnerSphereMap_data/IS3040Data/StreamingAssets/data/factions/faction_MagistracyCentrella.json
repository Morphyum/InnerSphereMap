  "Description" : "The Oberon Confederation is a Periphery nation, located on the coreward rim of the Lyran Commonwealth near the Draconis Combine.  As a periphery realm, it sits on the very fringe of the Inner Sphere's Hyperpulse Generator network. The only known Confederation world to feature a functional HPG was the fairly well industrialized capital world of Oberon VI. Alternating between obscure periphery ministate and outright pirate kingdom at various points in time, the Oberon Confederation offers numerous opportunities for those mercenaries who are less than scrupulous in their dealings."
