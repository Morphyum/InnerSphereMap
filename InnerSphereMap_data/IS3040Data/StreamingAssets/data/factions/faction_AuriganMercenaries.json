  "Description" : "Formed in the wake of the Fourth Succession War, the Free Rasalhague Republic was created after Theodore Kurita was pressured into granting the rebellious border planets freedom. Rasalhague's proclamation of independence on March 13, 3034 was quickly recognized by ComStar and the Draconis Combine. Some Kuritan troops refused to obey Theodore's orders, but he crushed them in the Ronin War. As foreseen by Comstar, Lyran ruler Katrina Steiner turned over captured Rasalhague planets to the Free Rasalhague Republic (FRR). The new state sought to appease both the Commonwealth and the Combine through scrupulous neutrality, even adopting a policy of equal trade. Much mercenary work can be found amongst the border worlds, as pressure from both sides squeezes the Republic hard."
