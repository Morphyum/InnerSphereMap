  "Description" : "The Lothian League is a small Periphery realm composed of a small number of ice-and-snow planets located beyond the outer reaches of the Free Worlds League near the Marian Hegemony. Ruled by the Grand Mistress of the Lothian League, it has no standing army and relies on Mercenary units for military might."
