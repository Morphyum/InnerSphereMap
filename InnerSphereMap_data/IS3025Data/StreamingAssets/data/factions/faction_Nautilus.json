  "Description" : "The Circinus Federation is portrayed as an agrarian Periphery nation, at least on the outside. One look at the flag will tell you differently however, as the nation was actually formed by a Mercenary group called the Black Warriors back in 2770. The Black Warriors currently serve as the entire Circinan military. Never a truly unified force, the Black Warriors constantly test the loyalties of the various factions within their ranks. Their relationships with nearby nations is tenuous, resulting in many mercenary contracts being available for raiding or defence."
