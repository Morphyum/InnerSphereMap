  "Description" : "The Outworlds Alliance is a major Periphery power located spinward of Terra and the Inner Sphere, bordering both the Draconis Combine and the Federated Suns. This region of space has also been called the Outer Sphere. Mercenaries are often employed for garrison duty or limited defensive contracts, whilst some mercenary units are hired by business interests in the Alliance."
