# InnerSphereMap
The Inner Sphere Map is a BattleTech mod (using ModTek) adding the whole inner Sphere to the map.

## Special Thanks
This mod would not be possible without all the help i got so Special thanks to:

- Callyste, for making the icons
- LegendKiller [CSV], for providing his vectors of the icons
- Jalif, for making the awesome cinematic
- mpstark, for BTML without him we wouldn't have such awesome mods
- SaltyHotDog, for helping me gather the data on the planets
- Xavier, for providing us with the NBT data
- JamieWolf, for fixing ISM while i was not around!

## Features
- Over 2000 planets added.
- All the major factions added.
- Removed Story.
- Raised jumping distance to fit for the map.
- Faction Screen now shows all factions.

## Tips
- Don't freak out if loading to the main menu takes a bit longer, modloader does its thing while you jsut see a black screen.
